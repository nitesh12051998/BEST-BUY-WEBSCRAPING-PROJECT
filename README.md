As a market researcher in a digital appliances company "XYZ", I want to explore which technologies in the TV industry are the most popular in the US. To fulfill the task I initiated the project of collecting relevant information from the internet automatically, to make sure the decisions and strategies XYZ makes are data-driven and fit the market preferences.

This project involved scraping data from BestBuy on various TVs. The data was scraped at two levels, with level 1 scraping involving collecting information such as the name, brand, features, model number, etc of all TVs. Level 2 scraping involved accessing each product link to gather data such as the product name, Skuid, return period, warranty, and installment payment options. The data was primarily scraped using Beautiful Soup and stored in MongoDB. The level 1 data was stored in a collection called "best_buy_collection" and the level 2 data was stored in a new collection called "best_buy_product_level_collection". The collected data can be used to gain insights into consumer preferences, trends, and patterns in the TV market, as well as to inform pricing strategies and identify opportunities for innovation.
